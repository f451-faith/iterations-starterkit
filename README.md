# Starterkit for @media workshop

You will find on this repo a starterkit to use for starting a coding project or a prototype. Next to this `README.md` file, you will find an `index.html` file and an `assets/` folder, where the `CSS` and `Javascript` are located. In the `assets/css`, you will find a file named `_reset.css` that is used to reset the default styles of the browser and a `style.css` file where you can write your own styles. In the `assets/js` folder, you will find a `script.js` file where you can write your own Javascript.

To use it on your own project, you can clone it on your Desktop by typing this command in the Terminal:

```
cd Desktop && git clone https://github.com/f451-faith/iterations-starterkit.git
```

Or you can just download it by clicking the green button "Code" on top of this page.

From there, you can move it, modify it and do whatever you want with it!
